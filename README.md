Convert Sharepoint Link files (.aspx) to .url format 

MS Sharepoint has currently (March 2018) an issue with the Link Document elements: when downloaded via OneDrive or via Web and re-uploaded into another Sharepoint Library, they lose their 'link' nature and become binary rubbish: when clicking on such an element, instead of being redirected to the URL, the browser downloads the .aspx file.

Waiting for MS to solve the issue, this script converts the link to document apsx to a standard .url file.
